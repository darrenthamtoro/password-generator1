# password-generator
## about
In this project, we are given html, CSS, and starter JavaScript codes which would create a website. This website would function to give options of criterias that the user would like to have in their generated password. The user will then choose the criterias and a random password will be generated. The password generated is then displayed in the alert or written to the page.

The user first clicks on the "Generate Password" button which will then display a few questions about the criterias the user want for their password. These criterias include the length of the password, uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers. Once the user selects the criterias, the website will generate and display a random password which fits the users password criterias. If the user wants to create another random password, the user will have to press the "Generate Password" button again and the set of questions will appear. I attached a screen shot of an example of the password being generated in the website in the Assets folder.
